This is companion repo for medium tutorial series which talks about scaffolding an express api and adding functionality

I cover the following —

- Using Sequelize
  - `BelongsTo` and `HasMany` associations
  - `BelongsToMany` association using a joint table
- Using Passport for auth
  - `Passport-local` for authentication using email and password
  - `Passport-JWT` for using JWT to handle protected Routes
- Testing the API
  - Integration testing — Test available routes and responses
  - Unit testing — models and controllers
